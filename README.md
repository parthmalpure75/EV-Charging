# EV-Charging
The project aims to develop and implement a dynamic wireless charging system for electric vehicles, using inductive charging technology with Transmitters embedded underground and Receivers retrofitted to vehicles. 
The objectives of the project include increasing the adoption of electric vehicles, studying the planning and financing required for implementation, and evaluating the feasibility, potential cost savings, technical viability, and environmental benefits of the system over stationary charging stations.

The project is divided into four phases: initiation, planning, execution, and closure, with a total timeline of 1.9 years. During the planning and execution phases, a responsibility chart and resource allocation system were created to clarify team members' roles and avoid over or under-allocation of resources. The project stakeholders include product managers, project managers, engineers, testing teams, and other relevant stakeholders.

The project monitoring process involves identifying potential risks and promptly implementing appropriate solutions to maintain the quality of the project. This includes cost monitoring, time monitoring, and technical monitoring. Project control is established to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. The project auditing phase will evaluate the technical aspects of the project, project status, risks, procurement process, compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and quality control measures used in the project.

The project team used a bottom-up budgeting approach to determine the overall budget of $1,446,680. With this budget plan in place, the project team can ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively to meet project objectives. Overall, the project aims to provide an innovative solution for electric vehicle charging, improving sustainability and practicality.

1.1	Work Breakdown Structure

Developing a work breakdown structure for this project facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the individual tasks and intricacies involved in the project. The work breakdown structure (WBS) for this project is organized into four main phases: initiation, planning, execution, and closure. The planning phase is divided by 5 work packages and the Execution phase is divided by 4 work packages based on the technical components of the system.
  
During the initiation phase, the initial decision-making and resource planning for the project is established. This includes allocating the budget and gathering requirements for the entire project, which will help to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately in terms of time, cost, and personnel.

The second phase of the project is the planning phase, which occupies a significant portion of the project's calendar. This phase is divided into work packages such as location, road construction, charging infrastructure, vehicle systems, and testing. Site survey, site clearance, and grading are essential tasks for the location work package. 

The third phase, also known as the Execution phase, is the longest phase of the project. It mainly consists of four work packages, namely construction of road, charging infrastructure, vehicle system, and testing. Critical tasks during this phase include the installation of transmitters in the road structures, receivers in the vehicle, and software for system monitoring. Procurement of components and equipment for charging infrastructure, road construction, vehicle systems, and testing equipment sensors is a critical task in this phase. Testing is conducted for 158 days (based on Appendix B) during this phase to ensure the system functions properly under different conditions as a pilot project.

The final phase, known as the Closure phase, includes important tasks such as quality check and quality testing of the entire system. The creation of operating manuals and necessary documentation also takes place during this phase.

1.2	Schedule
Scheduling is a crucial part of this project as it enabled the identification of the project timeline and the time required for each task. It also enables the monitoring of activities and allocation of resources within set timeframes. In this project, scheduling was conducted by referencing similar real-life projects and dividing the work breakdown structure into manageable timeframes. MS Project was utilized to create the schedule and ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the process. By utilizing this software, the project team was able to adjust the schedule as needed and keep track of progress throughout the project's lifecycle.

The project is scheduled to run for a period of 1.9 years, commencing from the end of February 2023 and concluding at the end of November 2024 (This timeline is including the off days on weekends and American Holidays). The planning and execution phases of the project, serving as a pilot project, are expected to take 81% of project's timeline. Given that the project involves the construction of roads and the installation of charging infrastructure, it predominantly follows a sequential waterfall schedule, except for the procurement of components, which can be executed concurrently.

1.3 Execution Plan
The primary objective of project monitoring for this Dynamic Wireless Charging pilot project of a 2-mile track is to ensure the successful completion of the project within the allocated time and budget. The process involves identifying potential risks and promptly implementing appropriate solutions to maintain the quality of the project. To achieve this, a workstream will be designed based on the Work Breakdown Structure and RACI Matrix to monitor the key factors and indicators crucial to the project's success throughout its life cycle.

1.4	Project Monitoring
Cost monitoring: Costs associated with the development of the wireless charging system can escalate quickly without proper monitoring. A cost monitoring feedback loop enables project managers to establish a budget and cost estimates for the construction of the road, charging infrastructure, and vehicle system, track actual costs against them, and identify any cost overruns or potential overruns.

Time monitoring: A time monitoring feedback loop will enable project managers to establish realistic timelines and milestones, track progress against them, and identify any delays or potential delays in construction of the road, charging infrastructure, and vehicle system. By analyzing the causes of delays and taking corrective action, project managers can adjust timelines and milestones as necessary and continually improve time management.

Technical monitoring: The technical performance of the wireless charging system is critical to ensure its optimal operation. It will also enable to monitor progress against them and identify any deviations from requirements or potential deviations. By analyzing the causes of deviations and taking corrective action, project managers can adjust technical requirements and specifications as necessary and continually improve project technical performance.
